// Mixins are a way of reusing a classâ€™s code in different class hierarchies. For example, you might have a class called Employee which has methods like clockIn. The code in those classes may be useful for both Bartender and Nurse. But, now imagine you're introducing a class called Doctor. You probably have some functionality on Nurse (such as a method called takeTemperature) that you'd like on Doctor, but not that you want to add to Employee. This is a great place to use a mixin called Medical.



// class Employee {

// void clockIn() {...}

// }



// mixin Medical {

// int takeTemperature {...}

// }







// // use mixins on your classes via the `with` keyword

// class Nurse extends Employee with Medical {}

// class Doctor extends Employee with Medical {

// performSurgery() {...}

// }

// class Bartender extends Employee {}

// With this architecture, your bartender can 'clock in', but cannot 'takeTemperature'. Both Nurse and Doctor can do both, and the doctor can performSurgery.
